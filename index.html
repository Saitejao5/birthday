        <h2>üíå Love that i have never said to youüíå</h2>
      
        <p class="quote">‚ÄúYou are the sunshine that lights my day, the moonlight that guides me at night, and the heartbeat that keeps me alive.‚Äù</p>
      
        <p>A warrior went to sea after winning the seven kingdoms with his bro, taking his sword filled with blood. He placed his sword on the rock, looked at the sea, and closed his eyes. Then his bro said, ‚ÄúYou never lost and own everything.‚Äù</p>
        
        <p>He said, ‚ÄúI lost in the war of love and got wounds which can never heal. It‚Äôs all nothing when I don't have her.‚Äù</p>
        
        <p>I'm done waiting for someone and hoping that someone will come. I hope love never finds me again; even if it does, I won't fall in again because it always leaves pain only.</p>
      
        <p class="center">Nindu chandhamama nunchi jaluvare venneladhi entha andhamo<br>
        Nindu vennelalo egasipade samudranidhi entha andhamo<br>
        Anthati andham thana sontham</p>
      
        <p>My heart lets me remember your eyes; even my mind does.</p>
      
        <p>Ra oka mabhuvai appati dhaka badha tho thadisiunna na manasanu ne prema ane chunukuthe thadipenthala</p>
      
        <p>Who are you? Not chosen one by he.</p>
      
        <p>Ethina kalam nekosame ani ela cheppanu<br>
        Rasina prathi aksharam negurinche ani ela cheppanu<br>
        Unna bhadhi ne Valle ani ela cheppanu<br>
        Ela cheppanu lenu santhoshanni nuvvu mathrame thesukuravalavu ani<br>
        Ela cheppanu na praname nubbe ani<br>
        Ela cheppanu nuvvu lekapothe nenu lenani<br>
        Ela..ela...!</p>
      
        <p>The story is not about the queen who rejected a boy; it‚Äôs the story of a boy who loved the queen and fell for her.</p>
      
        <p>I have mistaken by hiding feelings on you,<br>
        Love on you,<br>
        Pain of mine.</p>
      
        <p>Nekai edhuru chuse na kallake thelusu edhuruchupante ento<br>
        Na kalanike thelusu na premante ento<br>
        Ne premakainthapinche naa manasuke thelusu na premante ento<br>
        Nekai edhuru chese nake thelusu ne medha unna prema elantidho</p>
      
        <p>If she asks how are you,<br>
        She asked how are you, I said:<br>
        Leni memories tho,<br>
        Unna prematho,<br>
        Leni friendship tho,<br>
        Moyalenantha bathatho,<br>
        Maruvalentha prematho edho ala unna.</p>
      
        <p>How should I hold hope on happy endings in love if it every time makes wounds deeper and deeper?</p>
      
        <p>Rani premanu ela thegalanu?<br>
        Unna premanu ela chupagalanu?<br>
        Lenu premanu ekkadani vethakanu.</p>
      
        <p>How could I say my poetry was not fiction? It‚Äôs all about you.</p>
      
        <p>Somewhere you and me, I built a bridge with hope of love.</p>
      
        <p>Even when you are here in front of me, I have no words to tell.</p>
      
        <p>Love is like an arrow ‚Äî the deeper it goes, the deeper the wound becomes. I‚Äôm already way too deep in.</p>
      
        <p>People say one-sided love is more beautiful, but they don't know how painful those are.</p>
      
        <p class="center">Happy birthday to you, the special one who makes me happy all the time,<br>
        To the person with whom I could share everything,<br>
        To the person I always want to be with,<br>
        And you are the one where I can feel very comfortable to be.</p>
      
        <p>The day you walked into my life, you made every day special to me because you are the one I always wanted.<br>
        I still remember the day I met you, the day you texted me, and how happy I felt whenever I saw your eyes.<br>
        You made me pick up the pen to write; you are the reason I write.<br>
        I always write about you in every word of mine.</p>
      
        <p>There was something missing in my life.<br>
        The day you walked into my life, it was complete.<br>
        The day you came into my life, I got new hopes which I lost.<br>
        I started smiling again.<br>
        I started feeling the emotions of those eyes again.</p>
      
        <p>My honesty made me wear a mask of friendship in place of love.<br>
        Even though it was okay because you are always the moon letting me feel you from the distance.</p>
      
        <p>If you left, I don‚Äôt know what would happen.<br>
        But one thing is sure: I‚Äôll keep writing to show I am loving you.</p>
      
        <p>Thanks to the special person:<br>
        With whom I could share everything,<br>
        To the person where I am comfortable,<br>
        To the person who always made me happy with her texts,<br>
        To the person who always let me feel love from her.</p>
      
        <p>Writing was never my thing until I saw your eyes.<br>
        Even after you left me, writing will be with me forever.<br>
        Thanks to you, people say only broken hearts can feel the depth in poetry ‚Äî and finally, now I can...</p>
      
        <p>If this is the send-off, I wish to say thank you to the special one.<br>
        The day I fell for you, I started writing.<br>
        I feel a lot when I am with you.<br>
        Even though you left, writing will never leave.<br>
        Every letter of mine is for you.<br>
        Even if you left me, you‚Äôre going to stay with me always in words.<br>
        Every letter of my poetry, every word of my poetry represents you.</p>
      
        <p>At the end, for all his efforts, he got nothing.<br>
        In the end, she came to him and asked, ‚ÄúDid you love me?‚Äù Holding an ocean in his eyes, bro says ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>
      
        <p>My grandpa always says when the day comes you get stuck with a woman and your eyes always look for her presence, then she is the girl you want.<br>
        And I think this is the day ‚Äî and you are the girl.<br>
        Will you be mine forever until death separates us and even after death?</p>
      
        <p>When she texts, it feels like heaven, but if she says ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we be friends?‚Äù it hurts like hell.</p>
      
        <p>I am the one who got wounds in place of love, and I am the person who got pain in place of happiness.<br>
        In the war of love, I never won but was pierced with wounds instead of love and pierced with pain instead of happiness.</p>
      
        <p>I did everything and got nothing except wounds and pain.<br>
        She never said ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù but her eyes say it every time she looks at me.</p>
      
        <p>I priced friendship in place of love.<br>
        I priced pain in place of happiness.<br>
        I priced wounds in place of memories.<br>
        And finally, I priced death in place of life with her.</p>
      
        <p class="center">Prematho rayalsina kathanu kannillatho rasa<br>
        Enthala ante naa kallu samudramtho nindenthala<br>
        Enthala ante aa samudrame inkenthala<br>
        Enthala ante nenu nuvvu ayyenthala nelo kalisenthala</p>
      
        <p>Kavalanukunnappudu ninnu chudadam kante vadhu anukunnappidu ninnu chusthuntene premante ento thelusthundhi.</p>
      
        <p>If there are 99 reasons not to be together, in 100 even there is 1 reason to be together, don't you think it‚Äôs enough?</p>
      
        <p>The day you walked into my life,<br>
        You brought the happiness which left me,<br>
        You brought the hopes which I lost,<br>
        You brought feelings that will never come back.</p>
      
        <p>How crazy it is, in the millions of people, my eyes always look for you.</p>
      
        <p>Why can't we become stronger again?<br>
        Strangers like the day I saw you,<br>
        Strangers like the day I met you,<br>
        Strangers like the day your eyes talk a lot even when you aren‚Äôt.</p>
      
        <p>My honesty made me wear a friendship mask in place of love to hold you in life.</p>
      
        <p>If there is no hope, why do I need to chase?<br>
        What should I chase when there is no hope?<br>
        What should I chase when there is no end?<br>
        Is there any point in chasing something which I do not know?</p>
      
        <p>Long nights, empty roads, me and my dreams ‚Äî can I really achieve it?</p>
      
        <p>Why can't we become stronger again?<br>
        Strangers like the day I saw you,<br>
        Strangers like the day I met you,<br>
        Strangers like the day your eyes talk a lot even when you aren‚Äôt.</p>
      
        <p>Why do you always want to talk?<br>
        Because I can't hold thousands of feelings in my heart; I want to share with you.</p>
      
        <p>Come into my life, the special one, and make it beautiful like the way the moon makes the night beautiful in the sky.</p>
      
        <p>Where are you, the special one? Here in my heart, I am waiting for you by holding thousands of feelings and emotions.<br>
        My heart can‚Äôt hold them all ‚Äî come and relieve me.</p>
      
        <p>I was waiting for you to make my life bright like the moonlight makes the night so beautiful.</p>
        <div >
            ‚Äî From the poet who writes you in his every word,  
            with deepest love that‚Äôs never shown ‚Äî
